## Ordering the PCB


As you can see I pretty much uploaded the [latest cherry gerber file avalilable on foostan's repository](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/releases) in https://jlcpcb.com and let almost all defaults settings.
![Ordering PCB](/crkbd-v3/jlcpcb.jpg)
_After a day I placed the order they sent me an email asking for an extra U$ 4.00, ~~I didn't understand what happened, but I just paid it and everything worked fine.~~ [@Soziapath](https://github.com/Soziapath) sent me an email explaining that the extra fee may occur if the jlcpcb reviwer understand that your gerber file had two different pcb's (mirrored is still different). [More details](https://jlcpcb.com/quote/pcbOrderFaq/Different%20Design%20in%20Panel)_

## Firmware

### Install/Configure QMK

First to compile the crkbd qmk firmware you will need to use avr-gcc 8. 

In Arch use the following commands to install the dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman --needed -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/a/avr-gcc/avr-gcc-8.3.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
sudo pacman -S --needed \
       arm-none-eabi-binutils \
       arm-none-eabi-gcc \
       arm-none-eabi-newlib \
       avrdude \
       avr-binutils \
       avr-libc \
       base-devel \
       clang \
       dfu-programmer \
       dfu-util \
       diffutils \
       gcc \
       git \
       libusb-compat \
       python \
       python-pip \
       unzip \
       wget \
       zip
```

Then clone the [qmk firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and then

### Compile/Flash Firmware

```bash 
make crkbd:default:flash
```

This will compile and start to flash the firmware, make sure your pro-micro is connected in the usb port and the following message will be shown:
```bash
QMK Firmware 0.9.19
WARNING:
 Can not run bin/qmk! This tool will be required when the develop branch is merged on 2020 Aug 29.

 Please run util/qmk_install.sh to install all the dependencies QMK requires.

At this moment, with some tweezers, reset the pro-micro
![Reseting Pro-Micro](/crkbd-v2/01-flashing-the-firmware-1.jpg)

If you did right the following will be shown:
```bash

Do this for both pro-micros and you good to go.

## Building

### Prepare OLEDs

Remove the oleds legs for socketing can be quite challenging, I lost some oleds during this phase.
![Preparing oleds](/crkbd-v3/01-preparing-oled.jpg)

### Prepare PCB

Just cut the the pcb out
![Preparing pcb 1](/crkbd-v3/02-preparing-pcb-01.jpg)

Those conections are ugly let's trim them out.
![Preparing pcb 3](/crkbd-v3/02-preparing-pcb-03.jpg)

I like to paint the sides of the pcb to have a better finish.
![Preparing pcb 4](/crkbd-v3/02-preparing-pcb-04.jpg)
![Preparing pcb 5](/crkbd-v3/02-preparing-pcb-05.jpg)

I used POSCA for painting the pcb sides.
![Preparing pcb 6](/crkbd-v3/02-preparing-pcb-06.jpg)

### Solder PCB top components

An easy thru-hole solder.
![Soldering top pcb 1](/crkbd-v3/03-soldering-top-01.jpg)

I used some masking tape to help me.
![Soldering top pcb 2](/crkbd-v3/03-soldering-top-02.jpg)

Result.
![Soldering top pcb 3](/crkbd-v3/03-soldering-top-03.jpg)

### Solder pro-micro

I used some masking tape to help me organize the wires.
![Soldering pro-micro 1](/crkbd-v3/04-soldering-promicro-01.jpg)

Also another benefit of using masking tape is to don't let the solder go thought the hole and "glue" with the PCB socket.
![Soldering pro-micro 2](/crkbd-v3/04-soldering-promicro-02.jpg)

Result.
![Soldering pro-micro 3](/crkbd-v3/04-soldering-promicro-03.jpg)

### Solder OLEDs

I used isolation tape to separate the led from the pro-micro
![Soldering oled 1](/crkbd-v3/05-soldering-oled-01.jpg)

Same process as the pro-micro.
![Soldering oled 2](/crkbd-v3/05-soldering-oled-02.jpg)

Result.
![Soldering oled 3](/crkbd-v3/05-soldering-oled-03.jpg)

### Solder diodes

The SMD diodes are trick at first, they are pretty small and they have polarity, make sure to match the polarity with PCB.
![Soldering diodes 1](/crkbd-v3/06-soldering-diodes-01.jpg)

To make it easier to solder, first put some solder on one of the PCB diode contacts and then with a tweezer hold the diode over the solder and heat it to stick the diode, proceed to the other diode contact and solder it normally.
![Soldering diodes 2](/crkbd-v3/06-soldering-diodes-02.jpg)

### Solder hot swaps

Very similar to soldering the diodes, but with a way bigger component.
![Soldering hotswap 1](/crkbd-v3/07-soldering-sockets-01.jpg)
![Soldering hotswap 2](/crkbd-v3/07-soldering-sockets-02.jpg)

### Solder under glow leds

All leds have polarity make sure you align your as picured bellow.
![Soldering underleds 1](/crkbd-v3/08-soldering-underleds-01.jpg)

As the diodes, first put some solder on one of the PCB led's contacts and then with a tweezer hold the led over the solder and heat it to stick on the pcb, proceed to the other leds contacts and solder it normally.
![Soldering underleds 2](/crkbd-v3/08-soldering-underleds-02.jpg)

This led is quite challenging to do, be prepared fo some arduous solder job, make sure you have some flux to guide your lead.
![Soldering underleds 3](/crkbd-v3/08-soldering-underleds-03.jpg)

### Solder per-key leds

Exacly as the other leds, this leds also have polarity align as picured bellow.
![Soldering keyleds 1](/crkbd-v3/09-soldering-keyleds-01.jpg)

Result.
![Soldering keyleds 2](/crkbd-v3/09-soldering-keyleds-02.jpg)

### Mount the case

Just some screws and the build was almost finished.
![Mount the case 1](/crkbd-v3/10-case-01.jpg)
![Mount the case 2](/crkbd-v3/10-case-02.jpg)

Adding the switches over the case.
![Mount the case 3](/crkbd-v3/10-case-03.jpg)

### Finished

Some led showoff.  
![Finished 1](/crkbd-v3/11-finished-01.gif)

With the keycaps.
